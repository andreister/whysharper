#summary If you like the project - consider a donation. All money goes to a charity.

I created _Whysharper_ in my spare time, and it was relatively easy to do. And also I'm paid handsomely well in my daily job.

So I don't expect any money from this project. However, if you feel excited about it - you still can donate. *All money would go to a charity.*

Add up a few points to your karma (and to my karma) and help people in need. Sounds like a fair deal.
